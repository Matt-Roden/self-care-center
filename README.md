##### User Information:

_Main function_: This application allows a user to enter their name to login, which then brings them to a new page that displays a personalized greeting and they can choose either a mantra or an affirmation to be displayed on the screen. They can continue to generate random mantras and affirmations.

#### How to Use the App:

##### Steps for Logging In:

1. User types in their desired name into the box labeled, "Your name goes here...".

2. Once name is entered. Click on the "Login" button.

3. The login page will disappear and the main page will show after clicking.

#### Steps for choosing a message:

1. Choose between either a mantra or affirmation by selecting an input labeled either "mantras" or "affirmations".

2. Once a selection is made, click the button labeled "Receive Message".

3. Below the button, the meditation icon will disappear and a randomly generated mantra or affirmation will be displayed in it's place.
